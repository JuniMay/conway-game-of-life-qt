<img title="" src="images/icon.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" align="center" data-align="center">

A crappy implementation of Conway's Game of Life in qt.

## Usage

1. make sure qt is well configured
2. `qmake && make`
3. open executable file.
4. click cells to change state.
5. `configure` button to set color, size, etc.
6. `evolve` button to evolve (shortcut: press space).
7. `file->load` to load pattern.

## Roadmap

- [x] load pattern from file
- [x] save pattern to file
- [ ] automatically evolve
- [x] generate random pattern
- [ ] move mouse to draw
- [ ] icons
- [ ] optimization && improving performance
- [ ] put some members into right position
- [ ] add other features
